# Memory_Game
Create a Memory Matching mobile app for Android using Android Studio. 
This game requires you to improve your memory by having you match the same pair or images ( logos in this case ). It's a two players game which means you can compete with your friends or compete with your self.
It also keeps track of your scores and pairs of cards found and annouces the winner when all the cards are matched.
